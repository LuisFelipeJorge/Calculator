# Calculator 

This project was an opportunity to learn a little about applications that use React technology. I implemented in a simple way the design of a calculator (motivated by a course on the Udemy platform), which copies the model of the Mac calculator. With that, I was able to learn how to implement some basic elements of a React project, such as classes, arrays, states of variables ,  how to use some basic concepts of css technology, how to create components and import/exports its properties and also how to organize an project according to its purpose.
